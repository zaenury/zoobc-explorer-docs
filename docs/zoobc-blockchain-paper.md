## Abstract

Since the emergence of Bitcoin, a plethora of blockchain technologies have emerged, each approaching
certain limitations of the original design in their own way. In the same spirit, as a first step in
what we intend to be a sequence of gradual experimental improvements, we here propose a new blockchain
architecture and generally describe its structure. Among other points, we focus on reducing the blockchain
download time to a constant, more evenly distributing block creation and network rewards among nodes which
prove they are doing useful work for the network, and creating a flexible and testable technological base
for others who which to extend the platform to include business logic specific to their domain.
Finally, we explore the security and performance implications of each new strategy where they differ
from other blockchain technologies.
